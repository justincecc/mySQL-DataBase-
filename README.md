You will have to install mysql to run and use this code
If youd like to use the display output function youll need to 
install pandas and IPython
 
Everything else should work fine without pandas and IPython
You'll need to setup a datbase server on mySQL and set a password for it
I have mine saved in variables so you can change that and should work fine

Besides that everythin is setup for you to run and play with it

Most of my comments walk you through how each function works so you should be able
to use and play with them pretty easily

Hope you enjoy
